# Rock, Paper, Scissors

## What is this?

Rock, paper, scissors! Usually one of the first things I do when learning a language is figure out how to write a version of RPS in it, because it's a good exercise in things like conditional logic and functions.  

This is a web app written in vanilla JS.

## Why does it exist?

I've actually already done this exercise in JS at the console log level. The goal here was to take that already existing code and adapt it to a visual GUI, using HTML and CSS.

More specifically, I wanted this to be an exercise in:
* CSS animations
* CSS flexbox
* Dynamic styling
* DOM interactions via JavaScript

## To-Do

Currently, the app is functional at the basic level. However, there are some things I'd still like to do before I can call it complete.

* Tweak the styling for better contrast and more consistent color theming
* Add more animations
* Ensure the app is responsive to different screen sizes
